## Summary

1. One of the drawbacks for the website is that unless the users already have the data in hand; otherwise, it will be difficult determine what parameter to use in order to filter the data accurately.
2. For the place holder of date search, we can use MM/DD/YYYY which will help the user to know the date format or simply add a calendar widget to make it more user friendly.  
3. Add an button to clear the data on the filter search and not to include a place holder so that the users will not be confused whether the filter ID was actual place holder. 
4. Provide a dropdown list and include a check box in case if the users would like to filter the data in more than one category, such as State and Date.
